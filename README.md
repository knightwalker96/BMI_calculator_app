# bmi_calculator

This is an app created so that users can give their age, weight, height and their gender as input 
and the app returns back their BMI correct to the first decimal.

This is an app through which i learnt a lot of things like Routing, Slider widget available in Flutter
, the Card Class, enumerators , how to create your own custom widget, and many more things in the process.
